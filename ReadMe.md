# PixLyzer pregenerated data

The data is mostly not up-to-date. That means, that I am not regenerating the data for older versions/snapshots.
The newest version should always be up-to-date, the [major](https://gitlab.bixilon.de/bixilon/pixlyzer/-/blob/yarn/wrapper/PixLyzer.py#L61)
versions are also getting updated from time to time. 

If you want me to update the data for a specific version, don't hesitate to contact me [bixilon@bixilon.de](mailto:bixilon@bixilon.de).
